To bring the MOA into legal bunding force, it needs to be subscribed by its members. The Key/founding members of the company are the ones that initially subscribe to the MOA. Section 3 of the Act states that a company can be formed when the statutory requirement of the requisite company is signed by their specified no. of members i.e :A copy of the MOA after duly being signed is then submitted with the responding ROC. ROC then provides a certified copy of the MOA to the public upon payment of the prescribed fees.Format of MOAThese are the key elements or clauses that MUST be included in the MOA. The memorandum of a company shall be in respective forms specified in Tables A, B, C, D and E in Schedule I as may be applicable to such company. Section 4(6) talks about the forms that need to be filled as1) Table A \u2013Companies limited by shares2) Table B \u2013 Companies limited by guarantee not having a share capital3) Table C \u2013 Companies limited by guarantee having a share capital4) Table D \u2013 Unlimited companies not having a share capital5) Table E \u2013 Unlimited companies having a share capitalDrafting MOAThe vital parts of an MOA are Name Clause, Registered Office Clause, Liability Clause, Capital Clause and Association Clause. Before Drafting an MOA, the members need to be clear about the objectives of the company and the scope of its activities. Further there should be an Articles of Association (AOA) complimenting the MOA, that takes care of the internal details of company\u2019s governing aspect.In short, the memorandum enables shareholders, creditors and all those who deal with the company to know what its powers are and what the range of its activities is.Essential Clauses of MOAThere are 6 essential clauses in MOA, which is as following: Name ClauseThis defines the type of ownership of the company. A public company ends with \u201cLimited\u201d. A private company has to end with \u201cPrivate Limited\u201d. Government companies don\u2019t need to use either of the two.

Where a company changes its name or obtains a new name, it shall within a period of fifteen days from the date of such change, give notice of the change to the Registrar along with the order of the Central Government, who shall carry out necessary changes in the certificate of incorporation and the memorandum.

As the Constitution of India can be amended, the same applies to MOA as well. Over time, there will be a need for amendments in MOA, which is allowed with a set of compliances that need to be taken care of while alteration. Alterations have a lot of compliances attached to it so as to protect the shareholders and investors from getting defrauded. Companies Act, 2013 makes it compulsory for every company to have its own articles and file the same with ROC for registration.References"}
